# SNHU CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming

The goal of the app I developed in this course was to build a fully functioning UI with the goal in mind of creating a calendar event tracking app. The app was built to give the user easy to use UI and easy to travel from different screens.

The design of the screens keeps the important information to the user shown. The UI is also designed to be easy on the eyes, beautiful, and simple. 

I approached the development of this app by designing the UI first and then creating the functionality last. This way I feel is better because designing UI does not require functionality but you cannot create functionality without creating the UI, without having the objects and layout done it is more diffucult to create lone functionality. 

The most difficult part of this project was experimenting with the constraints for each of the different layouts. I used RelativeLayout and ConstraintLayout, each of them have their pros and cons but I prefered using the RelativeLayout because the objects are configured follow a layout designed relative to it's surroudnings.
